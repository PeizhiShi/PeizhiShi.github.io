    "# Seminar 1: Python Fundamentals for Business\n",
    "# Goals:\n",
    "#   - Get comfortable reading and writing Python code for business contexts\n",
    "#   - Build basic “business logic” using variables, calculations\n",
    "#   - Practise core programming structures: types, conditions, loops, lists, dicts, functions\n",
    "#   - Learn NumPy and Pands fundamentals for efficient numerical computing\n",
